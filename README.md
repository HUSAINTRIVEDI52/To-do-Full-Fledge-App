## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Backend Setup (Node.js + MongoDB)

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
````

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create an `.env` file**:
   Copy the example and fill in your own credentials.

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Edit `.env`** with your MongoDB URI and server port:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. **Run the server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The backend server will start on the port defined in your `.env` file (default: 3000).

### 📱 Frontend Setup (Flutter)

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Get Flutter packages**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the Flutter app**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

> Make sure you have a simulator or physical device connected.
